# ü§ù Contributing to Scholarly

Thank you for considering contributing to **Scholarly**! We appreciate your help in making this project better. Please take a moment to review the following guidelines before you start contributing.

## üìî Database improvement

I would really appreciate if you help me update the database with real data from internet, for that you need to scrape the net with scholarship details and provide that data in sql insert command format like:

```
INSERT INTO scholarships (name, description, provider, amount, deadline, url) VALUES
-- Scholarships from Webpage 1
('Vyasakabi Fakirmohan Bhasabruti Scholarship 2025', 'Partial funding for residents of Odisha pursuing any subject.', 'Government of India', 20000, '2025-01-22 23:59:59', 'https://www.wemakescholars.com/other/government-of-india/scholarships');
```

```
INSERT INTO eligibility_criteria (scholarship_id, min_ssc, min_hsc, min_graduation, caste_category, created_at) VALUES
(1, 50, 50, 0, 'General', NOW()),

```

You can mail me the data on:
